1. Score on development corpus wsj_24.word:

31431 out of 32853 tags correct
  accuracy:    95.67

2. Bi-gram Viterbi is used.

3. Unknown words treatments are used to improve performance:
for example, if the word begins with an upper case character, then tag = "NNP"

4. Log probabilities used to improve performance: for very long sentences, the Java double type used to store viterbi probability will underflow, decreasing accuracy.
